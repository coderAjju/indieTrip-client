        <p className='my-2'>
          Akbar Fort, located in Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), is a splendid example of Mughal architecture and a significant historical landmark. Built by Emperor Akbar in 1583, this massive fort stands at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati rivers, known as the Triveni Sangam. The fort is renowned for its robust construction, intricate design, and majestic grandeur.

          Inside the fort, visitors can explore a variety of attractions, including the Ashoka Pillar, a sandstone obelisk dating back to the 3rd century BCE, and the Saraswati Koop, believed to be the source of the Saraswati River. The Patalpuri Temple, an underground shrine, and the immortal banyan tree, Akshayavat, are other significant features within the fort's premises.
        </p>

          Though part of the fort is occupied by the Indian Army and not accessible to the public, the remaining sections offer a fascinating glimpse into Indiaâ€™s rich historical and cultural heritage. Akbar Fort stands as a testament to the architectural brilliance and historical significance of the Mughal era, drawing visitors from around the world.
